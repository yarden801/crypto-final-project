TODO:
1. fix docker problems
3. implement shared revocation scheme
4. implemet a hirerchal scheme (enable ca to sign other ca's or implement a seperate root)
5. test schenarios - faulty/maliciolus servers 
6. mention in the report that we are using a fixed seed (or implement a solution)
7. If BLS takes too much time- revert to only shamir
